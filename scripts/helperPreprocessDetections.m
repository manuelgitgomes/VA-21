function detections = helperPreprocessDetections(detections)
    % This function pre-process the detections from radars and cameras to
    % fit the modeling assumptions used by the tracker

    % 1. It removes velocity information from camera detections. This is
    % because those are filtered estimates and the assumptions from camera
    % may not align with defined prior information for tracker.
    %
    % 2. It fixes the bias for camera sensors that arise due to camera
    % projections for cars just left or right to the ego vehicle.
    % 
    % 3. It inflates the measurement noise for range-rate reported by the
    % radars to match the range-rate resolution of the sensor
